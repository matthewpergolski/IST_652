# LAB ASSIGNMENT 3

## LAB ACTIVITY THREE: Working with FUNCTIONS. 

### Problem 1:

Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list. 
    Sample List : (8, 2, 3, -1, 7)
    
    Expected Output : -336

    Execute the function with at least 3 different lists of numbers.

### Problem 2:

Sample String : 'The quick Brown Fox’

Execute the function with at least 2 different phrases.


Submit your code for Problem 1 and 2, along with your output from the running of your code in both Problem 1 and Problem 2, in a Word document.
Due 24 hours before the live session in Week 7.
 Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper
 case letters and lower case letters.
