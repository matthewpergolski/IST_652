    "    A function can be defined as the organized block of reusable code, which can be called whenever required.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python allows us to divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as a function. \n",
    "    The function contains the set of programming statements. \n",
    "    A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Function helps the programmer to break the program into smaller parts. \n",
    "    It organizes the code very effectively and avoids the repetition of code. \n",
    "    As the program grows, functions make the program more organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python provides us with various built in functions, like range() or print(). \n",
    "    Although we can make use of these built in functions,\n",
    "    we can also create our own functions, which are called user-defined functions.\n",

    "The advantages of using functions are:\n",
    "1. Reducing duplication of code.\n",
    "    In general, anytime you're going to be doing the same thing multiple times, you should use a function. \n",
    "    That way, whenever you need to do that action, you just call the function, \n",
    "    rather than copy & pasting the same code again.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Decomposing complex problems into simpler pieces.\n",
    "    It helps to divide the large programs into small groups so that we can read the code, \n",
    "    and debug the program faster and better.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improving clarity of the code.\n",
    "    Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks \n",
    "    that match how we think about the solution to the problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Reuse of code.\n",
    "    Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. \n",
    "    As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Information hiding.\n",
    "    The goal of information hiding is to protect the rest of the system from these design changes in that, \n",
    "    if a design decision changes, the resulting code change is limited to the associated programming module.\n",
